# Guava Project

Welcome to the Guava Project! This repository hosts both the front-end and backend for the Guava application. The application is designed to display articles on nutrition and sports. 

## Tech Stack

The project uses a variety of technologies:

1. **Frontend:** The front-end application is built with Flutter. It features a complete, custom design that aligns with the Guava graphical identity.

2. **Backend:** The backend is a NestJS application. It serves APIs for managing articles and their respective contents. Data persistence is handled by MongoDB.

3. **Deployment:** Docker is used for easy and efficient deployment of the application.

4. **Database:** MongoDB is the database of choice for this application.

5. **State Management:** Flutter's BlocBuilder is used for managing global state in the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Guava application on your local machine, you need to ensure that the following tools are installed:

- Flutter: The front-end is built with Flutter, so you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. 

- NestJS: The backend of the application is built with NestJS, which requires Node.js to be installed on your machine. We recommend installing it via NPM (Node Package Manager).

- Docker: Docker is required for the deployment of the backend. 

- Yarn: We use Yarn for managing our JavaScript dependencies.

- Firebase: The application uses Firebase for a number of services. Make sure to install the Firebase CLI on your machine.

Once you have all of these tools installed, you can refer to the respective `README.md` files in the [front](./front/README.md) and [back](./back/README.md) directories for instructions on how to run each part of the application.

We're excited for you to contribute to the Guava Project. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please open an issue or a pull request. Happy coding!
